# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

Ans: it can be easy at times, because it seems simple. Sometimes it is too simple that it can be confusing at times. I'd say it would be better if it was somewhat more specific so it can be more clear, because sometimes it can look like it is all over the place.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Ans: What python and other languages have similar is the idea of importing things from outside the code. For example: in python, you import different classes like (import random) for randomization, and Java has classes like Rectangle, and they all require a code to import it. The difference would be the way it is imported. In Python, you can just put "import" whatever and it'll be imported. In Java, you require import and some kind of long and specific text that can only be found at a library. Python makes things easier to remember things while Java makes it harder.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Ans: I learned how to manipulate lists in loops, if statements, and in functions. As long as it can be translated to an integer I can use it to make conditions in these problems. I am also learning how to take the work step by step so I can find my problems in the code and resolve them. I am learning to check each part of the entire code to see if it will work properly and be able to move on without worrying about it.
